    <h2>Technical Skills Summary모</h2>
    <p>
      Alongside my artistic practice, I’m skilled in <strong>software development</strong>, 
      <strong>web design</strong>, and <strong>data visualization</strong>. 
      I’ve built a range of projects, from mobile apps with secure login systems to real-time dashboards using wearable data.
      I regularly work with tools like <strong>Python, Java, HTML/CSS, SQL</strong>, and <strong>REST APIs</strong>.

        <h3>Athletic Centralized Dashboard</h3>
        <p><em>Current Capstone Project</em></p>
        <p><strong>Frontend Developer and Scrum Master</strong> | Tech Stack: Python Flask, HTML, CSS, Jira</p>
        <p>
          <br>
          My capstone team and I work alongside the Seshadri Lab at Lehigh University Bioengineering Department to develop a centralized web application for 
          our Lehigh Athletics. Seshadri Lab is a research lab led by Dr. Dhriuv Seshadri that aims to use engineering technologies and 
          inovations to help revolutionize healthcare. This capstone is a newly developed project and my team and I had to create everything from scratch.
          From desgin documents, to the technical architecture we were tasked with choosing the best tech stack and choices that aligns with their needs
          whilst also considering the long-term longevity of this project. As a Scrum Master and Frontend Developer, I helped organize our team's sprint reports and schedules,
          helped create our design documents and website mockups, and help create the UI/UX of the dashboard with feedback from the lab.

          For privacy reasons, we can't some functions of the website as we are handling real-time data of Lehigh althetes' personal data.
          Our goal for this year-long capstone project is to be able for our sponsor to upload CVS from any of the wearable technologies's APIs, visualize that data through graphs and charts, 
          and help both coaches and athletes to help visualize performance data, injuries, and recovery times better.

        <h3>The Buzz Mobile App</h3>
        <p><em>Software Engineering Class Project</em></p>
        <p><strong>Backend, Frontend, Mobile</strong> | Tech Stack: Java, Supabase, PostgreSQL, HTML, CSS, Jira</p>
        <p>
          <br>
          I worked alongside a cross-functional team on a semester-long project to develop The Buzz, a social alerting mobile app for students inspired by Instagram. Contributed to backend development, including secure user authentication and database integration, while supporting Agile sprint planning and collaborative project management.
          After a certain number of Sprints, our team was tasked with choosing which roles we would do. During this semester-long project, I had the roles of
          Project Manager, Backend Development, Admin, and Mobile Development. Our goal was to create a mobile application, similar to the functionalities of Instagram.
          While we were able to create that at the end of the semester, we were dealt with some setbacks as each role only had a certain amount of time to get things completed before the end of the sprint.
          Despite the obstacles, I learned alot about the Agile cycle, how Backend works with Supabase and the Admin, and most importantly how to work and communicate with a team to help overcome these challenges.

        <h3>Summer Camp Survival</h3>
        <p><em>Game Jam Project</em></p>
        <p><strong>Developer and 2D Artist</strong> | Tech Stack: Phaser</p>
        <p>
          <br>
          I collaborated on a game jam project as a developer and 2D artist to create a point-and-click zombie survival game using Phaser. The theme of this Game Jam was "One Button" where the entire gameplay
          can only use one button. My team and I decided that a point-and-click game would be fun and easier to implement for our 24 hour game challenge. I  was tasked with designing some gameplay mechanics and interactions, while illustrating all of the original 2D assets in Procreate to set the eerie, post-apocalyptic tone. The objective of our game was simple -
          you are a camper and you need to help your fellow campers escape safely into your tent. While there are so many improvements that could be made for the game, like dialogue or more interactive objects, I learned alot about 
          how map generation works, how to add hitboxes on objects, how to randomly generate trees on the map, and so much more!

        <p><strong>Developer and 2D Artist</strong> | Tech Stack: React, Procreate, Figma</p>
        <p>
          <br>
          I served as both developer and 2D artist in a game jam team to create That’s My Jam!, a fast-paced sandwich-making game where players assemble sandwiches to match customer orders. This project was my first game jam, with the prompt being "Jam". This was the also the first time
          I used React for a project and I was able to learn alot!
