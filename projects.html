    <h2>Technical Skills 모</h2>
    <p>
      Alongside my artistic practice, I’m skilled in <strong>software development</strong>, 
      <strong>web design</strong>, and <strong>data visualization</strong>. 
      I’ve built a range of projects, from mobile apps with secure login systems to real-time dashboards using wearable data.
      I regularly work with tools like <strong>Python, Java, HTML/CSS, SQL</strong>, and <strong>REST APIs</strong>.

        <h3>Athletic Centralized Dashboard</h3>
        <p><em>Current Capstone Project</em></p>
        <p><strong>Frontend Developer and Scrum Master</strong> | Tech Stack: Python Flask, HTML, CSS, Jira</p>
        <p>
          My capstone team and I work alongside the Seshadri Lab at Lehigh University to develop a centralized web application for organizing wearable data collected from Lehigh athletes. Designed for use by coaches, the platform replaces fragmented team-specific systems with a unified, user-friendly interface. Built with HTML, CSS, Flask, and a connected database, the project emphasizes usability, efficiency, and scalability through Agile development and close collaboration with the Bioengineering lab.
