    <h3>MEET JASMINE</h3>
    <h1>3D Blender Artist &<br>Software Developer</h1>
    <p>
      I'm Jasmine Linang, a computer science student at Lehigh University focused on creating inclusive digital experiences through frontend development and data-driven design. With a background in 3D modeling and tools like React and Python, I bring a creative, community-minded approach to tech.

    <h3>Mid-Century Modern Dresser</h3>
    <p>
      <br>
      A mid-century modern dresser modeled in Blender, featuring tree wood textures,
      arched glass-panel doors, and gold hardware. Designed with cubes, cylinders,
      and subtle lighting to emphasize material detail and form. This image was taken within the Blender's in-built camera function. I used free textures that I found online 
      to help with the realistic look of this asset. 
    </p>
     <p>
      <br>
      I'm currently in the process of creating my own furniture asset pack to use when I design full isometric rooms in blender. This asset pack would include chairs, tables, 
      beds, dressers, plants, and many other items that help make a room feel like a home. I take inspiration and 
      references from my own Pinterest board, personal taste, and some design shows. What I love about building your own assets is the fact 
      that I'm able to add as much detail as I want to and be able to import my work into a bigger build that I'm working on.

      <br>
      Stay tuned on my Blender journey!

      <h3>Isometric Loft Bedroom</h3>
      <p>
        A cozy loft-style interior modeled in Blender, featuring a split-level design with detailed cabinetry, a staircase, and natural lighting elements. Rendered in grayscale to highlight form and structure.

        I am currently in the process of fully rendering some of my older Blender builds as I recently upgraded to a better performing PC.
        This isometric loft was created on my MacBook Air and with many, many, many crashes and buffering I was able to complete it without texturing.
        Fun fact about me-I studied architecture in highschool! I am familiar with floor plans and 3D modeling as I've worked in AutoCAD for four years.
        However, since I pursued Computer Science in college I realized how much I missed desgining. One day, I woke up and decided today was the day I was going to learn Blender. 
        With my background in Computer Science, I hope to one day be able to code an interactive project with my own Blender creations!
