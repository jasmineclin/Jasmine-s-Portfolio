   Hi, I’m Jasmine Linang, a Computer Science student at Lehigh University passionate about building technology that is not only functional but thoughtful, inclusive, and creatively designed. I thrive at the intersection of logic and imagination, where I can apply my technical knowledge to real-world challenges while keeping the user experience at the heart of everything I create.

At Lehigh, I’ve had the opportunity to work on a wide range of projects, from developing a wearable tech dashboard for Lehigh Bioengineering Department to co-creating mobile apps and interactive games. My experience spans from backend development with Flask and REST APIs, frontend design with HTML, CSS, and React Native, and creative development using tools like Blender and Procreate. Whether it’s designing intuitive interfaces, managing project sprints, or illustrating assets for a zombie survival game, I’m always eager to bring ideas to life through both code and design!

<br>
Outside of academics, I’m actively involved in the campus community—serving as President of Kapamilya, Vice President of the Polynesian Student Alliance, and a retired Teaching Officer for the Lehigh Cybersecurity Club. These roles fuel my commitment to fostering diverse, supportive spaces where collaboration and innovation can thrive.
Alongside my CS studies, I enjoy diving into 3D modeling with Blender, digital illustration with Procreate, and exploring visual design as a creative outlet. These hobbies not only recharge me but also enhance my technical work by sharpening my eye for detail and visual storytelling.
In everything I do, I aim to blend creativity, technical skill, and community-driven purpose to build experiences that matter.
